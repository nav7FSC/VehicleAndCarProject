# Vehicle and Car Java Project Lab 1 CSC 311

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a basic Java class hierarchy with a `Vehicle` class and a `Car` class. The `Car` class extends `Vehicle` and includes additional attributes and methods.

## Project Structure

- **Vehicle.java**: Defines a `Vehicle` class with attributes `numberOfWheels`, `color`, `engineSize`, and `fuelType`.
- **Car.java**: Extends `Vehicle`, adding the `brand` attribute and methods like `honk()` and `displayInfo()`.
- **Main.java**: Contains the `main` method to test the classes by creating instances of `Vehicle` and `Car` and invoking their methods.
